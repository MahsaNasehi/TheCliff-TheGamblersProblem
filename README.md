# The Gambler's Problem
The gambling event is to bet an amount on coin outcomes where heads is a winning wager and tails is losing. We take the probability of heads being selected as a parameter and the gambler’s goal is to get to a score of 100. Getting to 0 is a loss. The gambler can have current states from 1, 2, …, 99 (i.e., the amount of money he has).

Bets can be made up to the amount of money that the gambler has, but not an amount that would bring the total to over 100 in the event of a winning bet.

For example, if the gambler has 60, the maximum bet is 40 because anything over 40 would result in a score of over 100 with a win.

# The Cliff Walking Problem
Cliff walking involves crossing a gridworld from start to goal while avoiding falling off a cliff.

The player makes moves until they reach the goal.
